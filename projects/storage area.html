                    During my Summer 2021 internship with Mauser Packaging I was tasked with clearing out a storage area and implementing
                     a First-In-First-Out inventory system for production components. The first step was to separate the useful production
                      components from the trash and take inventory of everything useful. Next, the trash was all disposed of, and the still 
                      valuable machines were moved to another storage area. I coordinated the delivery of a large forklift and a flatbed 
                      from a local scrap metal company to get rid of the remaining scrap machines. The smaller boxes of components were stored
                       on shelving units while pallet racking was ordered for the pallets. I found a local supplier selling used pallet 
                       racking and ordered from them instead of Grainger, saving 30% plus freight costs since we could pick it up with one 
                       of our own local trucks. All of this opened up additional storage space which allowed us to consolidate our drum lid 
                       inventory into a single location. Two rows were designated for each lid type, allowing for a FIFO system to be 
                       executed. Several chemicals that were previously stored outside were also moved inside and placed on containments. I 
                       planned out the entire area in LibreCAD before moving anything in to ensure the most efficient use of space possible.
