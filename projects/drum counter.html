                    The manufacturing plant I interned at during Summer 2021 reconditioned 55-gallon steel drums to be resold. The plant had been around since the 1940s and 
                    continued to operate in much the same way as it had back then. The only production data being logged consistently was the final number of drums produced
                     each day, which was collected manually using mechanical counters. Information like rejection rates and individual machine throughput wasn't logged. After 
                     researching off the shelf data loggers, I realized that I could make a far more robust version for a fraction of the price. I made two of these counters 
                     so that they could be placed at different points around the plant, allowing for information like the rejection or throughput rates at certain steps of the 
                     reconditioning process to be measured.
                    <br><br>
                    The drum counter was controlled by an Arduino Nano and would be powered through USB. The counter included a real time clock (RTC) module, a micro-SD card 
                    reader, and an LCD for displaying data and navigating menus. A key challenge for this project was memory management on the Arduino. One of the most 
                    important features of the counter was its ability to read files from the SD card in order to display past data. However, the library that I was using to do 
                    this required a 512 byte buffer to open the file, which was causing memory issues. To fix this, I first scaled down all of my global integer variables. Since 
                    many of them were only counters that weren't at risk of integer overflow, I could get away with using Unsigned Shorts instead of Ints in many cases. I then
                     started using #define instead of Const for all of my constants so these variables were no longer stored in memory. Finally, I changed several of the constant 
                     Strings in my code to be stored in program memory (PROGMEM) instead of SRAM. This required some extra work, since Arduino is based on C and so all Strings 
                     are stored as character arrays instead of objects which meant they worked a little different than I was used to. In the end I was able to reduce memory usage
                      significantly and got everything working as intended.
