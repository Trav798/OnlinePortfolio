                    This was my main project for the Purdue Electric Racing club, Purdue's SAE electric club. It was a 3D printed 
                    PLA enclosure for the high and low voltage electrical systemsâ€™ master switches. The enclosure was designed in 
                    SolidWorks and fabricated with 3D printing. It was attached to the car for testing before the FSAE competition 
                    was canceled and everyone was sent home due to COVID-19. The enclosure included mounting points for the two switches 
                    (the two large circled on the front), the power indicator lights, and a separate detachable module on the bottom for 
                    two banana jacks.
                    <br><br>
                    The enclosure was designed to take up as little space as possible to have a minimal impact on the car body's aerodynamics 
                    while still completely enclosing the electrical components. The FSAE Rulebook mandated that the TSMP (Tractive System 
                    Measurement Points) mount, seen here at the bottom of the enclosure, had to be separated by a physical barrier from the 
                    rest of the components. The TSMP mount also needed to be insulated and waterproofed, a requirement that did not apply to 
                    the rest of the enclosure. Because of this I decided to design it as a separate module that would be waterproofed before 
                    being permanently glued into place.
